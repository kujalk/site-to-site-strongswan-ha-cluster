- Don't use master for testing. Use follower for testing. 
  Reason, is traffic is routed via Master EC2, but when it returns it used PCX connection, which make 
  security group to reject the traffic, that means, master cannot be destination and source of traffic

- ENI is not updated properly due to race condition, so added extra delay in cloud-init script for 
  follower 

- Use this command to monitor traffic -> tcpdump -i eth0 icmp

To do, 

if master of site1 fails ,

1. update the routing table in site1 -> eni and pcx 
2. update the routing table in site 2 -> pcx
2. call the ssm document to update the other side /etc/ipsec ip address
